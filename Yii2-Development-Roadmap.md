Our next major release Yii 2.0 will be full rebuilt on top of PHP 5.3.0+, leveraging the new language features as well as the feedback we have received on 1.1.

Yii 2.0 will not be compatible with 1.1. However, we will try every effort to make the transition as easy as possible.

If you have a new project to develop on Yii, do not wait for 2.0 as it will still take considerable time to reach the production quality.
